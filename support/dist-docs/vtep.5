.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

When a physical switch integrates support for this VTEP schema, which is expected to be the most common case, this column should point to one \fBPhysical_Switch\fR record that represents the switch itself\[char46] In another possible implementation, a server or a VM presents a VTEP schema front-end interface to one or more physical switches, presumably communicating with those physical switches over a proprietary protocol\[char46] In that case, this column would point to one \fBPhysical_Switch\fR for each physical switch, and the set might change over time as the front-end server comes to represent a differing set of switches\[char46]

BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control messages\[char46] VTEPs are expected to implement BFD\[char46]
.PP
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a rate negotiated independently in each direction\[char46] Each endpoint specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages, and the rate at which it\(cqs willing to transmit them\[char46] An endpoint which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period of three times the expected reception rate will signal a connectivity fault\[char46] In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the system not receiving BFD control messages will signal the problem to its peer in the messages it transmits\[char46]
.PP
.PP
A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability of devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges data\[char46] This can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service node among a set of service nodes providing high availability\[char46] It also enables the NVC to report the health status of tunnels\[char46]

In many cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open vSwitch instance\[char46] The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880\[char46] Open vSwitch does not implement the optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode\(cq\(cq features\[char46]

.PP

Tunnel protocols tend to have a field that allows the tunnel to be partitioned into sub-tunnels: VXLAN has a VNI, GRE and STT have a key, CAPWAP has a WSI, and so on\[char46] We call these generically ``tunnel keys\[char46]\(cq\(cq Given that one needs to use a tunnel key at all, there are at least two reasonable ways to assign their values:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Per \fBLogical_Switch\fR+\fBPhysical_Locator\fR pair\[char46] That is, each logical switch may be assigned a different tunnel key on every \fBPhysical_Locator\fR\[char46] This model is especially flexible\[char46]
.IP
In this model, \fBPhysical_Locator\fR carries the tunnel key\[char46] Therefore, one \fBPhysical_Locator\fR record will exist for each logical switch carried at a given IP destination\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Per \fBLogical_Switch\fR\[char46] That is, every tunnel associated with a particular logical switch carries the same tunnel key, regardless of the \fBPhysical_Locator\fR to which the tunnel is addressed\[char46] This model may ease switch implementation because it imposes fewer requirements on the hardware datapath\[char46]
.IP
In this model, \fBLogical_Switch\fR carries the tunnel key\[char46] Therefore, one \fBPhysical_Locator\fR record will exist for each IP destination\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBtunnel_key\fR: optional integer"
This column is used only in the tunnel key per \fBLogical_Switch\fR model (see above), because only in that model is there a tunnel key associated with a logical switch\[char46]
.IP
For \fBvxlan_over_ipv4\fR encapsulation, when the tunnel key per \fBLogical_Switch\fR model is in use, this column is the VXLAN VNI that identifies a logical switch\[char46] It must be in the range 0 to 16,777,215\[char46]
.ST "Replication Mode:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
For handling L2 broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic, packets can be sent to all members of a logical switch referenced by a physical switch\[char46] There are different modes to replicate the packets\[char46] The default mode of replication is to send the traffic to a service node, which can be a hypervisor, server or appliance, and let the service node handle replication to other transport nodes (hypervisors or other VTEP physical switches)\[char46] This mode is called service node replication\[char46] An alternate mode of replication, called source node replication involves the source node sending to all other transport nodes\[char46] Hypervisors are always responsible for doing their own replication for locally attached VMs in both modes\[char46] Service node replication mode is the default and considered a basic requirement because it only requires sending the packet to a single transport node\[char46]
.IP "\fBreplication_mode\fR: optional string, either \fBservice_node\fR or \fBsource_node\fR"
This optional column defines the replication mode per \fBLogical_Switch\fR\[char46] There are 2 valid values, \fBservice_node\fR and \fBsource_node\fR\[char46] If the column is not set, the replication mode defaults to service_node\[char46]
